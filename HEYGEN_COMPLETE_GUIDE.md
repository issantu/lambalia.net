# 💡 PRO TIPS FOR HEYGEN

## Script Optimization:

1. **Add Pauses:**
   - Use commas for short pauses
   - Use periods for longer pauses
   - Use "..." for dramatic pauses

2. **Emphasis Words:**
   - Put important words in ALL CAPS
   - Example: "TRANSFORM your kitchen"
   - HeyGen will add natural emphasis

3. **Numbers:**
   - Write out: "one thousand" not "1,000"
