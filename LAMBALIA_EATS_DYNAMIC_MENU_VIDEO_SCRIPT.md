# VIDEO 10: "Lambalia Eats - The Future of Food Ordering" (60-75 seconds)

## FOR HEYGEN (Recommended) OR PICTORY

## SCRIPT VERSION 1: ENTHUSIASTIC/FAST-PACED (60 seconds)

```
Stop ordering from menus. Start creating them.

Introducing Lambalia Eats. The first truly dynamic food marketplace.

Here's how it works: You don't browse a menu. You POST what you want to eat.

Craving your grandmother's Jollof rice? Post it.
Want authentic street tacos at 2 PM? Post it.
Need gluten-free Biryani for tonight? Post it.

Then home chefs BID on your order. Multiple chefs compete. You see their proposals. Their timing. Their prices.

Chef Maria can make it by 3 PM. Chef Carlos offers pickup in 2 hours. Chef Priya suggests a ingredient swap that's even better.

You choose. Or negotiate through in-app messaging.

Missing ingredient? The app tells you. The chef tells you. You adjust together in real-time.

Flexible delivery: Pick it up yourself. Chef delivers to you. Or hand off to DoorDash if the chef is busy.

This isn't food delivery. This is collaborative cooking. Demand-driven. Dynamic. Different.

Traditional apps? Fixed menus. Take it or leave it.

Lambalia Eats? You decide what gets cooked. Chefs decide if they can make it. Magic happens.

lambalia.com. The future of food is here.

Your craving. Their kitchen. One platform.
```

**Duration:** 60 seconds

## SCRIPT VERSION 2: DETAILED/STORYTELLING (75 seconds)

```
Tired of scrolling through the same restaurant menus? Wishing you could just order exactly what you're craving?

Welcome to Lambalia Eats. Where the menu doesn't exist until you create it.

Here's the revolution: Instead of choosing from a fixed menu, you post what you want. An advance order for your perfect meal.

"I want Nigerian Jollof rice by 6 PM tonight."
"Need vegan tacos for lunch tomorrow."
"Craving my grandmother's recipe for Chicken Adobo."

Post it. And home chefs in your area see your request.

Now here's where it gets interesting: Chefs BID on your order.

Chef Maria says she can make your Jollof by 5:30 PM for 45 dollars. Chef Amara offers 6 PM for 40 dollars but suggests adding plantains.

You see all proposals. Compare prices, timing, chef ratings. Pick your favorite. Or message them to negotiate.

And here's the best part: Real-time ingredient flexibility.

Missing an ingredient? Both you and the chef know instantly through the app. Message each other. Adjust the recipe. Substitute ingredients. Collaborate.

"Can't find palm oil for Jollof? How about using olive oil plus spices?"

You decide together. It's cooking, but collaborative.

Delivery? Your choice. Pick it up. Chef delivers. Or if they're busy, handoff to existing delivery apps seamlessly.

This is food ordering, reimagined. Not a fixed menu. A dynamic marketplace responding to your exact craving.

Traditional delivery: Here's our menu. Choose something.

Lambalia Eats: Here's my craving. Who can make it?

lambalia.com. Stop ordering from menus. Start creating them.
```

**Duration:** 75 seconds

## SCRIPT VERSION 3: PROBLEM/SOLUTION FORMAT (65 seconds)

```
Three problems with food delivery today:

Problem one: You want something specific. It's not on the menu. You settle.

Problem two: Restaurants have fixed offerings. You can't customize. You can't request.

Problem three: Missing ingredients? Order gets cancelled. No alternatives. No flexibility.

Lambalia Eats solves all three.

Here's how:

You post what you want to eat. Not what's available. What you're actually craving.

Home chefs see your post. Multiple chefs bid. They tell you:
• What they can make
• When it will be ready
• How much it costs
• Suggested modifications

You compare bids. Pick your chef. Or message them to adjust.

Ingredient missing? The app alerts both of you instantly. You chat in real-time. Adjust the recipe together. Find substitutions. Solve it collaboratively.

"Missing saffron for Biryani? Here are three alternatives that work."

Flexible delivery: You pick up. Chef delivers. Or seamless handoff to DoorDash if they're busy.

This is demand-driven food. You create the order. Chefs compete to fulfill it. Ingredients adjust dynamically. Everyone wins.

Traditional apps: Take it or leave it.
Lambalia Eats: Make it or negotiate it.

The only platform where YOUR craving drives what gets cooked.

## LinkedIn Version (Professional, 45 seconds)

```
We just revolutionized how people order food.

Traditional food delivery: Restaurants list menus. Customers choose from what's available.

Lambalia Eats: Customers post what they want. Home chefs bid to make it.

It's reverse marketplace economics applied to food.

The workflow:

1. User posts advance order: "Need gluten-free pasta for dinner"
2. Multiple chefs bid with proposals, timing, pricing
3. User compares bids, selects preferred chef
4. Real-time messaging for ingredient adjustments
5. Flexible fulfillment: pickup, chef delivery, or app handoff

The result? 

Demand-driven cooking. Dynamic menus. Collaborative customization. Better economics for chefs. Perfect meals for customers.

This is what happens when you listen to what people actually want instead of limiting them to what's already on a menu.

Lambalia Eats. Now live at lambalia.com.

# 📧 PRESS RELEASE ADDITION (Feature Announcement)

## Add This Section to Press Release:

```
REVOLUTIONARY FEATURE: LAMBALIA EATS DYNAMIC MENU

Unlike traditional food delivery where customers choose from fixed restaurant menus, Lambalia Eats introduces a reverse marketplace model where customers post what they want to eat, and home chefs bid to make it.

"This is the future of food ordering," said Issa Issantu, Founder and CEO. "Why should customers be limited to what's already on a menu? With Lambalia Eats, your craving drives what gets cooked."

The system works through advance orders. A customer posts: "I want authentic Nigerian Jollof rice by 6 PM tonight." Multiple home chefs see the request and submit bids with proposed timing and pricing. The customer compares proposals and selects their preferred chef.

Real-time ingredient flexibility sets Lambalia Eats apart. If a chef discovers a missing ingredient, both parties are alerted through the app. They communicate via in-app messaging to adjust the recipe, substitute ingredients, or modify the dish to match available resources.

Delivery options are equally flexible: customers can pick up meals themselves, chefs can deliver directly, or orders can be handed off to existing delivery apps when chefs are busy.

"It's collaborative cooking," added Issantu. "The customer and chef work together to create the perfect meal. It's not ordering from a menu. It's co-creating your dining experience."

Early users report higher satisfaction rates compared to traditional delivery, citing the customization options and direct chef communication as key differentiators.
