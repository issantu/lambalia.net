## üîß Technical Details

### Service Worker Caching Strategy:
- **Static Assets**: Cache first, network fallback
- **API Calls**: Network first, cache fallback
- **Images**: Cached indefinitely
- **User Data**: Always fetch fresh

### Cache Storage:
- Cache name: `lambalia-v1`
- Automatic cleanup of old caches
- Smart cache invalidation

### Offline Behavior:
- Cached pages work offline
- API calls use cached data when offline
- Custom offline page for uncached routes
- Queue API calls for when online (future)

## üìà Next Steps: Native App Development

### When You're Ready (After Saturday Testing):
1. **Upgrade to Emergent Paid Plan** - Unlocks Mobile Agent
2. **Access Mobile Agent** - Select "Mobile" from agent dropdown
3. **Reuse Backend** - Your FastAPI APIs work as-is
4. **Rebuild Frontend** - Mobile Agent converts to React Native
5. **Deploy to App Stores** - iOS App Store + Google Play

### Mobile App Advantages Over PWA:
- Better performance
- Full device access (camera, GPS, contacts)
- Push notifications (better reliability)
- App store discovery
- Native UI components
- Offline-first architecture

## üí° Tips for Saturday Testing

1. **Clear Browser Cache** between tests
2. **Use Incognito/Private** mode for fresh installations
3. **Take Screenshots** of issues for debugging
4. **Test on Real Devices** not just emulators
5. **Check Network Tab** in DevTools for caching
6. **Monitor Console** for service worker logs

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Install Prompt Doesn't Appear:
- Already installed? Check home screen
- PWA requirements met? (HTTPS, manifest, service worker)
- Try in incognito mode
- Clear site data and refresh

### Service Worker Not Registering:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/service-worker.js` is accessible
- Check HTTPS (required for service workers)
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Offline Mode Not Working:
- Wait 1-2 minutes after first visit (caching time)
- Check DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cache Storage
- Verify service worker is active
- Check network tab shows "(from ServiceWorker)"
