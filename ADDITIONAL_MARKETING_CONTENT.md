Year two? 1,800 dollars monthly. Now her main income.

She cooks what she's cooked for 40 years. Nothing new. Just gets paid for it.

No gig economy exploitation. No dancing for algorithms. No selling your time for pennies.

Cook for 10 hours weekly. Earn 500 to 2,000 dollars monthly. Build your retirement cushion.

Your recipes are worth money. Your skills are assets. Your experience is valuable.

Start today. Retire comfortably tomorrow.

# 🎥 VIDEO 9: "Cultural Heritage is Disappearing. Save It." (60 seconds)

## FOR HEYGEN (Serious, Documentary Style) OR PICTORY

**SCRIPT:**

```
Every day, a grandmother's recipe dies with her.

Authentic cultural cooking. Lost forever. Because nobody wrote it down.

Your mother's jollof. Your abuela's mole. Your nonna's carbonara.

These aren't just recipes. They're history. They're identity. They're heritage.

And they're disappearing.

Lambalia is different. We're not another food delivery app.

We're a cultural preservation movement. With a business model.

Upload your family recipes. Get paid to preserve heritage.

Teach your grandmother's techniques. Earn while educating.

Share your cultural food stories. Build community and income.

Ten years from now, your grandchildren will thank you. Because they'll have access to recipes you preserved.

Your culture has value. Literal dollar value. Three to thirteen dollars per consultation. Thirty to eighty dollars per meal.

But more importantly? Priceless cultural value.

Join Lambalia. Preserve heritage. Earn income. Leave a legacy.

Lambalia dot com. Where culture meets commerce.
