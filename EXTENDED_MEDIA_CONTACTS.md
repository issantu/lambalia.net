# 📧 CUSTOMIZED EMAIL TEMPLATES

## TEMPLATE: CHAMPAIGN LOCAL MEDIA

**Subject:** LOCAL ENTREPRENEUR: Champaign's Issa Issantu Launches Global Food Tech Platform

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out with a local success story perfect for your Champaign-Urbana audience.

CHAMPAIGN LOCAL LAUNCHES GLOBAL PLATFORM:

Issa Issantu, a Champaign, Illinois resident, is launching Lambalia on September 26, 2025 – a food technology platform now operating in 80+ countries.

THE LOCAL CONNECTION:

While Champaign is home base, the platform is empowering home chefs globally to earn $500-$2,000 monthly from their kitchens. It's a Champaign innovation with worldwide impact.

LOCAL IMPACT:

Champaign-Urbana residents can now:
• Order authentic ethnic cuisine from local home chefs
• Earn income cooking from home (part-time, flexible)
• Connect with the diverse international community in C-U
• Access recipes from 80+ countries

Given the University of Illinois's diverse international community, Lambalia is particularly relevant here. Students and faculty from Nigeria, Mexico, India, Italy, China, and dozens of other countries can share their cultural cuisine while earning income.

THE NUMBERS:

• 80+ countries represented
• $500-$2,000 average monthly earnings
• 1,000+ authentic recipes
• Only 10% commission (vs. industry 20-30%)
• Bank-level 2FA security

FOUNDER AVAILABLE:

Issa Issantu is available for interview. Local angle, global impact. Classic Champaign innovation story.

Would you like to feature this? I can arrange interview, provide photos, and connect you with local home chefs already using the platform.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Lambalia Press Office
press@lambalia.com

P.S. - This is the kind of local tech success story Champaign-Urbana readers love. Happy to provide sample meals from local chefs for review!

## TEMPLATE: NATIONAL TECH MEDIA (AI/SOCIAL FOCUS)

**Subject:** LAUNCH: AI-Powered Food Platform Preserves Cultural Heritage While Generating Income

**Email Body:**

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

Quick pitch: A Champaign, IL founder just launched an AI-powered platform that's simultaneously solving cultural preservation and gig economy income inequality.

THE TECH STORY:

Lambalia (launching Sept 26) uses AI/ML for:
• Recipe matching and recommendation algorithms
• Intelligent ingredient substitution suggestions  
• Cultural cuisine authentication verification
• Local supplier inventory matching
• Multi-language NLP for recipe translation

But the compelling story isn't just the tech stack – it's what it enables.

THE HUMAN IMPACT:

While DoorDash drivers earn minimum wage, Lambalia home chefs earn $500-$2,000/month part-time. While mainstream platforms commercialize ethnic food, Lambalia preserves authentic cultural recipes before they disappear.

AI MEETS CULTURAL PRESERVATION:

Every grandmother's recipe represents irreplaceable cultural data. Lambalia's platform digitizes, indexes, and preserves this before it's lost – while monetizing it ethically.

Think: GitHub for cultural food knowledge + Airbnb economics for home chefs.

THE TRACTION:

• 80+ countries represented
• 1,000+ recipes preserved
• Home chefs keep 90% (platform charges 10%)
• PWA technology (works offline)
• 2FA security standard

FOUNDER: Issa Issantu, based in Illinois, built this after seeing two problems: valuable cultural knowledge disappearing, and home cooks unable to monetize expertise.

This intersects: AI/ML, social commerce, cultural preservation, gig economy evolution, food tech.

Worth covering?

Full technical details available. Happy to arrange founder interview or technical deep-dive.

Best,
[Your Name]
