The AI engineer's work began by stabilizing the Lambalia application and implementing core features like media uploads and profile enhancements. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to achieving universal translation across nine languages. This task proved challenging, marked by a recurring dots bug where translation keys were displayed instead of text. The root causes were twofold: incorrect JSON structure in  and the use of incorrect key paths in React components. After multiple protracted attempts, user frustration grew due to premature claims of success.

The focus then shifted to deployment on Vercel and Railway, where the engineer successfully troubleshooted critical environment issues, including missing variables () and dependency conflicts (). Post-deployment, the engineer fixed a bug where the Local Market page was stuck in Spanish by correcting faulty translation data and forcing a default language. The engineer then guided the user through a complex custom domain setup with Namecheap DNS.

Most recently, the engineer addressed critical post-launch bugs, successfully fixing the Browse Templates page by adding missing backend API endpoints and correcting frontend data handling. The work concluded with the user requesting major functional upgrades: expanding the recipe database with African cuisine, integrating a real grocery API for ingredient search, and building out a complete Quick Eats feature. The engineer had just added the African dish data to the backend.

<product_requirements>
The Lambalia application is a multi-featured platform for food enthusiasts. Initially, the goal was to stabilize the MVP, add core functionalities like SMS notifications, user ratings/tips, profile pictures, and media uploads for recipes.

A primary requirement has been to achieve near-perfect universal translation (95-98% accuracy) across nine languages, covering all UI elements, forms, and dynamic content. This proved to be a major undertaking.

Following a successful (but challenging) deployment to production with custom domains (), the user's focus has shifted to enhancing core features from static placeholders to fully functional, data-driven experiences. The current product requirements are:
1.  **Expand Recipe Database**: The Browse Templates feature must be expanded to include a comprehensive list of African dishes, sourced from real-world data (e.g., Wikipedia).
2.  **Functional Ingredient Search**: The Find Local Ingredients tool must be upgraded from displaying static, generic data to using a real-time grocery API. Results must be actionable, leading to a map or a purchase/delivery workflow.
3.  **Full Quick Eats Marketplace**: The Quick Eats feature needs to be built into a complete system that facilitates a transaction from discovery to purchase and delivery, with potential to become a standalone app.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, i18next (for internationalization), Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (with Motor driver).
- **Deployment**: Vercel (for frontend), Railway (for backend).
- **DNS Management**: Namecheap for configuring A and CNAME records.
- **APIs**: Integration with third-party grocery APIs is a new requirement.
- **Data Modeling**: Pydantic for data validation in FastAPI.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monolithic repository structure with separate frontend and backend directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Central configuration file for the i18next translation library. It contains all translation strings for all supported languages.
    -   **Recent Changes**: This file was heavily modified to correct structural issues (moving nested  keys to the root), add missing keys for numerous components (, , ), and fix incorrect English translations that contained Spanish text. A  setting was added to force a default language and fix a persistent caching issue.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that handles routing and contains the component definitions for many pages, including , , and various forms.
    -   **Recent Changes**: Significant work was done to replace hardcoded strings with  function calls. Most recently, the  component within this file was fixed to handle new API data structures correctly, adding null safety checks to prevent crashes (e.g., ).

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The component for the Local Market feature.
    -   **Recent Changes**: This file was the subject of an extensive debugging session to fix a bug where it was stuck displaying in Spanish. Hardcoded strings were replaced with translation keys, and debug  statements were temporarily added and removed.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file defining all API endpoints.
    -   **Recent Changes**: To fix the broken Browse Templates page, three missing endpoints were added:
        
        These endpoints serve the recipe data that the frontend was requesting, resolving the 404 errors.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic and data models used across the backend.
    -   **Recent Changes**: A comprehensive list of African dishes and countries was added to this file to expand the recipe database, fulfilling the user's latest request.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Real Grocery API**: Integrate a live grocery data provider for the Find Local Ingredients feature, replacing the current static, generic results.
- **Build Quick Eats Feature**: Develop the Quick Eats section into a fully functional marketplace with a complete purchase-to-delivery workflow.
- **Complete Universal Translation**: Although the user has moved on, the goal of 95-98% translation accuracy across all nine languages has not been fully met. Many components still require systematic replacement of hardcoded strings.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the engineer was actively addressing the user's latest set of feature requests aimed at transforming static pages into dynamic, functional experiences. The user reported that the Browse Templates menu was broken, the Find Local Ingredients search returned generic results, and the Quick Eats feature was non-functional.

The engineer successfully fixed the Browse Templates feature by adding missing API endpoints to  and correcting data handling logic in the  component in .

Following this fix, the user requested a major expansion of the recipe database to include African cuisine and a complete overhaul of the Find Local Ingredients tool to use real, actionable data from a grocery API.

The engineer's most recent actions were:
1.  **Research**: Conducted web searches to gather comprehensive data on African dishes from Wikipedia and to identify potential real-time grocery APIs.
2.  **Implementation (Phase 1)**: Began implementing the first request by editing  to add a large, structured database of African countries and their traditional dishes. This work is complete, and the backend now contains the necessary data to be served via an API. The next logical step was to begin work on the grocery API integration.

<optional_next_step>
Implement a real grocery API to make the Find Local Ingredients feature functional, as per the user's explicit request. This involves integrating an API and updating the backend and frontend to display actionable, real-time results.
