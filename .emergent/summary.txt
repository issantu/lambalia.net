<analysis>
The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Lambalia application from an unstable, partially deployed state to a significantly enhanced and functional one. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical deployment blockers: missing environment variables, backend crashes, and translation service import errors. Once stable, the engineer systematically implemented a series of major feature enhancements as requested by the user. These included integrating a missing Local Offers and Demands menu, developing a comprehensive SMS notification and tipping system, and a complete overhaul of the AI Smart Cooking tool with SuperCook-style functionality and HackTheMenu content. Critical bugs, such as a JSX error and snippet creation failure due to incorrect FastAPI router configuration, were also successfully debugged and fixed. The engineer also addressed branding removal and updated contact information. The work is currently focused on enhancing recipe snippets with image/video upload and display, demonstrating an iterative, problem-solving approach.

The Lambalia application, initially suffered from deployment issues including incorrect path routes, unwanted automated translations, and a missing Local Offers and Demands (LOD) menu item. The user also reported that the existing AI cooking tool was failing, had limited hackthemenu.com content, and couldn't generate AI recipes. Additionally, recipe snippet creation was broken.

The following enhancements were requested:
1.  **Trust & Security**: Implement SMS notifications for user registration, account changes, and all financial transactions. These SMS alerts must include a helpdesk contact.
2.  **Service Quality & Monetization**: Develop a post-service system to send SMS/email prompts for ratings and tip options. Tips should be deducted from the user's last payment method and allocated to the servicer. The user dashboard needs to display regular earnings and tips separately for tax purposes.
3.  **Branding**: Remove the Emergent badge from the website for clean branding.
4.  **Enhanced AI Smart Cooking Tool**: Fix the current failing AI tool. Incorporate SuperCook-like features for ingredient-based recipe generation and HackTheMenu.com content, ensuring full data population and correct AI recipe generation.
5.  **Snippet Media**: Enhance recipe snippet creation to allow users to upload a picture of the finished recipe (and optionally a short video) and ensure these media files are displayed when viewing snippets.
6.  **Contact Information**: Update the Contact Us menu with specific professional  email addresses (issantu.tembe@lambalia.net, contact@lambalia.net, support@lambalia.net, helpdesk@lambalia.net).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on enhancing the recipe snippet functionality in the frontend. This involves two primary parts:
1.  **Snippet Creation Interface**: The  component in  has been updated to include UI elements that enable users to upload images and videos for their recipes. This includes media preview and proper handling within the form submission.
2.  **Snippet Display**: The engineer is currently modifying the  component(s) found in . The goal is to ensure that the uploaded images and videos are correctly rendered and displayed when users view existing recipe snippets in various parts of the application, such as their profile or general listings. The trajectory concludes while the engineer is in the process of updating a  component for image display.
