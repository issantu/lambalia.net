The previous AI engineer effectively enhanced the Lambalia application, initially stabilizing it from deployment issues. Key achievements include implementing image/video uploads for recipe snippets, adding user profile pictures, and fixing the earnings withdrawal button. A significant focus was on achieving universal translation, systematically converting hard-coded UI text into  keys and applying them across numerous frontend components. This expanded language support to nine languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Arabic, Hindi). A critical bug, where translation keys (with dots) displayed instead of actual translated content, was traced to inconsistent  structure (e.g.,  keys incorrectly nested). The engineer has successfully fixed this for French and is currently addressing the same structural correction for Spanish, demonstrating a methodical approach to bug resolution.

The Lambalia application needed to resolve deployment issues, address unwanted automatic translations, and add a Local Offers and Demands menu. The AI cooking tool required fixing, content expansion (SuperCook-like, HackTheMenu.com), and recipe generation capabilities. Recipe snippet creation was broken.

The user explicitly requested and the engineer has implemented or is implementing:
1.  **Trust & Security**: SMS notifications for user registration, account changes, and financial transactions, including a helpdesk contact.
2.  **Service Quality & Monetization**: A post-service system for ratings and tip options, with tips allocated to the servicer and user dashboard displaying separate earnings/tips.
3.  **Branding**: Removal of the Emergent badge and updated contact information with  professional emails.
4.  **Enhanced AI Smart Cooking Tool**: Fixed the AI tool, incorporating ingredient-based recipe generation and HackTheMenu content.
5.  **Snippet Media**: Enabled image/video upload for recipe snippets and their display.
6.  **Contact Information**: Updated Contact Us with specific  email addresses.
7.  **Profile Enhancements**: Added profile picture functionality, enabled earnings withdrawal, and displayed comprehensive public profile information (location, dietary preferences, cultural background).
8.  **New Sections**: Added Community Outreach Agent job to Careers and a Store section.
9.  **Bug Fix**: Fixed the Find Ingredients tool backend integration.
10. **Universal Translation**: Expanded translation coverage beyond menus to all core content and forms across multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Arabic, Hindi).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on resolving a critical translation bug where translation keys (e.g., ) were appearing directly in the UI instead of the translated text, particularly on the Open Kitchen (restaurant) page. This dots issue was identified as a structural inconsistency in the  file: the  related translation keys for French and Spanish were incorrectly nested under a  object, while the application expected them at the root level of the language's  object.

The engineer successfully fixed this for French by moving the  section from  to  and removing the redundant nested entry. Immediately before this summary, the engineer identified the *same* problem in the Spanish translation. The engineer has just added the  section to the root level of the Spanish translation object and is now poised to remove the old, incorrectly nested  section from the Spanish translation in . This is the final step to rectify the dots issue for the Spanish Open Kitchen page.
