The AI engineer successfully transformed Lambalia into a sophisticated culinary social platform. Key developments within this trajectory include expanding the heritage recipe system to encompass global cuisines like Caribbean, and implementing a robust 2FA security system. A major UI/UX overhaul replaced cartoonish icons with professional SVG assets and introduced a monetized, AI-powered Smart Cooking Tool capable of generating culturally authentic recipes, refined to support African and Caribbean cuisines. A complex transaction verification system for Home Restaurants and Quick Eats was also established, featuring GPS/barcode verification and regulated service fees. The engineer diligently resolved UI layout issues, particularly with the Smart Cook button and language dropdown. The work concluded with the creation of training documents for Home Restaurant hosts, currently pending integration into the application's navigation.

<product_requirements>
Lambalia is a social media platform for sharing diverse recipes, emphasizing local ingredients and cultural heritage. It supports user profiles, recipe sharing (with media/tags), community interaction, and monetization via paid snippets, AI-translated DMs, local grocery integration, ads, and a Home Restaurant Platform. It also includes traditional restaurants and local farmers. Key features added are an offer/demand system, charity membership, and Lambalia Eats for food delivery/pickup. The user specifically requested expanding the heritage system to include all global communities (e.g., Caribbean, Indian, Korean), integrating specialty ethnic grocery stores, improving cartoonish UI icons, adding a monetized (-3) cooking tool (like Paprika, Yummly) for ingredient-based recipe discovery to the top menu, implementing a comprehensive payment/verification system for Home Restaurant/Quick Eats (GPS, barcode, payment hold, regulated service fees, complete meal structure), and creating training documents for hosts emphasizing passion over profit.
